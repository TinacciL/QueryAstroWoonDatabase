# Query Woon-Herbst moleculues-properties database

This is a program to query and extract all the species info, inside Woon-Herbst [database](http://www.astrochymist.org/properties/).
In the folder ```xyz_files``` you will find all the ```.xyz``` of the molecules in the database. Properties were computed at the
RCCSD(T) level with basis sets as large as aug-cc-pVTZ, depending upon the size of the molecule.

All the information coming from this database must be referred to the proper Scientific paper: "Woon, D. E., & Herbst, E. 2009, The Astrophysical JournalSupplement Series, 185, 273".
